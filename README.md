**Notes creating app with JS only**

I wanted to learn bulma css framework to compare it with Bootstrap, and to create the app, using plain JavaScript.

I build similar functionality on TO DO app, but it was with jQuery [link to to-do project](https://pinaska.github.io/to-do/)

***Built log***

- 08.13 - started with function addNewNote

- 08.14 - function addNewNote seems to be completed, all DOM elements were built.

- 08.30 - I have decided to move the project to glitch so it is easier t collaborate on it for somebody who does notwant to have merge via git. 

[please find it here:](https://glitch.com/~my-note-app)
